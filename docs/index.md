This transformational system led to substantially reduced response times for national crises, empowering police forces to act swiftly and decisively in critical situations.

C#, .NET 6, SCIM, EntityFrameworkCore, microservice, event driven architecture design, fully event sourced design with high throughput.

### Anonymous Communication, Professional Standards

I led a successful R&D initiative that evolved into a comprehensive system, enabling the Professional Standards Department to establish secure and anonymous channels of communication with officers willing to report concerns about their colleagues. This innovation fostered a culture of accountability and transparency within the organization.

C#, AspNetCore, SCIM, EntityFrameworkCore, cryptography, secure communications. 

### Agrochemical Procurement

I designed and developed an integrated agrochemical ordering system that seamlessly connected with third-party platforms. This system streamlined the procurement process, enhancing efficiency and enabling smooth collaboration with external partners.

C#, AspNetCore, Blazor, event driven with anti corruption layer for CRUD, Azure SQL, GitHub Actions, Azure App Service

### Nutrient Planner, Crop Nutrition

I designed and developed a nutrient planning system aligned with government standards outlined in RB209, revolutionizing the agricultural landscape. This system greatly improved the efficiency of farmers and agronomists, empowering them to optimize crop yields effectively and sustainably.

Built to government standards, RB209, used nationally to ensure safe and efficient yields of crops across the UK, C#, AspNetCore, WebAPI, RESTful.
